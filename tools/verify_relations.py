"""Mechanically verify that every nightly candidate names an existing card.

    verify_relations.py cards.md [--max N] [--know DIR] [--archive DIR]
                                 [--dry-run] [--self-test]

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A distillation pipeline PRODUCES; nothing in it MERGES. Measured in the reference
deployment after a year of nightly runs: 17 cards about one measured parameter,
14 about another, 8 about a third — one quantity, re-measured and written down as
new knowledge every time. In the same audit a contradiction sweep confirmed 75
contradictions in a 250-pair sample while the WHOLE base carried 8 superseded +
7 refuted edges, and the morning review's approval rate was ~100 %. Nothing between
the sweep and the knowledge directory ever asked "does this replace something we
already know?".

Asking the model to link is a REQUEST (the consolidate prompt has asked for links
from the start). This is the CHECK. Every candidate must carry exactly one line:

    RELATION: supersedes K-NNNNN BECAUSE <one sentence>
    RELATION: supports K-NNNNN
    RELATION: contradicts K-NNNNN
    RELATION: new — nearest K-NNNNN unrelated because <one sentence>

The id must EXIST; a `supersedes` target must still be LIVE — `status: active` or
`status: challenged` (an edge onto an already-superseded, refuted or condensed card
chains onto a dead end); and `new` must name one of the ids `tools/nearest_cards.py`
computed for that candidate, so "nothing in the base is close" cannot be asserted
about a card the retrieval layer never proposed.

NOTHING IS DELETED. A candidate that fails is MOVED, whole, into
`## DROPPED (no valid RELATION)` at the end of the file; a candidate over `--max` is
MOVED, whole, into `## DEFERRED`. Both sections are review plumbing: the approve
stage parses cards, not sections, so neither can become a card by accident, and the
morning review rescues anything by moving a block back under `## Cards`.

Exit 0 when nothing was dropped, 1 when something was (NON-FATAL in the pipeline:
wire it with `|| true`, exactly like verify_quotes.py — a validator that exits
non-zero for doing its job kills, under `set -e`, the night it was meant to
improve), 2 on a usage or format error.
