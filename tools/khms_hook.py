"""KHMS harness hook — the RETRIEVAL FLOOR.

One executable, wired to a handful of harness events (see claude-code/README.md):

  SessionStart        report an unreviewed inbox, and put the reply directive into
                      the session ONCE
  UserPromptSubmit    score the operator's message, inject matching cards, open a
                      gated turn for the retrieval-claim gate
  PreToolUse:Bash     run precheck.sh automatically for a named risky-command class
  PreToolUse:Edit|Write   score the file path and the edited text
  PreToolUse:<report tool>  the retrieval-claim gate: DENY a report whose `base:`
                      line cites cards that no recall of this turn backs
  PostToolUse:Bash / PostToolUseFailure   score the command and its error lines.
                      MEASURED AND SWITCHED OFF in the reference deployment — see
                      docs/measuring-injection.md before wiring them.

Why a floor at all: a rule that says "consult the base first" fails by never
firing, not by being wrong, and the moments it fails in are exactly the moments
the actor is too deep in a problem to remember it exists. So the cheap part is
automated, on a budget. It does NOT discharge the duty to search explicitly
before a hypothesis or a proposal — the hook cannot fire on a sentence that has
not been said yet.

Design rules this file obeys:
  * FAIL OPEN. Any exception is logged and swallowed; a broken memory system must
    never break the session it is trying to help.
  * EVERY DECISION IS LOGGED, including the silent ones, with the reason a card
    above the bar was not injected (dedup / cap / threshold). A hook that stops
    firing otherwise looks exactly like a quiet day.
  * BOUNDED. Thresholds, at most two cards, a character cap, a rate cap per
    window, a per-card dedup TTL — all of them §7 configuration, listed together
    at the top and meant to be recalibrated against your own .inject.log.
  * THE BUDGET IS SPENT BEFORE THE BASE IS LOADED. Every gate that needs no
    search result — the kill switch, the domain filter, the query cooldown, the
    rate cap, the per-event switch — runs before load_cards(). Measured in the
    reference deployment: 2324 hook calls in one day paid ~172 ms each for a
    card base they then threw away on a gate, and each of them also wrote a
    "nothing found" line into the retrieval log, which is how 87 % of that log
    came to be a record of non-retrievals.
  * WHAT IT INJECTS IS AN EXPERIMENT, NOT A CONSTANT. tools/khms_experiment.json
    switches injection off per event so the value of each one can be measured
    rather than assumed; deleting the file rolls everything back.

Kill switch: touch $KHMS_ROOT/tools/.hooks-off   (or export KHMS_HOOKS_OFF=1)

# ------------------------------------------------- the retrieval-claim gate

# it was a check whose passing condition held whether or not a retrieval had
# happened: the hook's own injection could satisfy it. That is the shape of the
# failure the base has a card about, applied to the compliance line itself.
#
# So: a report to the principal that CITES CARD IDS in its `base:` line, while no
# explicit recall of this turn matches the query it claims to have run, is DENIED.
# The gate is deliberately narrow. It denies exactly two things:
#   (i)  a substantial report with no `base:` line at all;
#   (ii) a `base:` line that cites card ids with no matching recall in this turn.
# A line that cites no card claims nothing about the base and is allowed; so is
# every honest form ("did not search", "nothing on record"). The thing being
# checked is a CITATION, not the wording of the line.
#
# REPORT_TOOL_RE is the tool through which the agent reports to its principal —
# the one action it cannot skip, because the principal only ever learns anything
