"""Acceptance tests for tools/nearest_cards.py.

Run:  python3 -m pytest tools/test_nearest_cards.py

The mechanical half of "merge pressure": before the consolidate stage is asked which
existing card a candidate supersedes or supports, it is TOLD which cards are nearest.
Zero model tokens, so it can run on every candidate of every night.

Four properties are guarded:
  (1) every candidate comes back with exactly one NEAREST line naming existing ids;
  (2) an ARCHIVED or non-active card is never proposed — a supersedes edge onto a
      retired card chains onto a dead end;
  (3) running it twice changes nothing, so a re-run in the pipeline or by hand during
      review cannot pile lines up;
  (4) `--only-missing` preserves a line carried through from the sweep.
The base is a temp directory; nothing here reads or writes a real one.
