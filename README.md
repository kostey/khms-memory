# KHMS — a file-based long-term memory an agent can install into itself

KHMS ("know-how management system") is a long-term memory for LLM agents made of plain
markdown files — in a git repository, or in a plain directory with hardlinked snapshots for
the deployments that will not put their memory in a repository at all. Every piece of knowledge is one immutable **card** with
YAML frontmatter — what kind of knowledge it is, how strongly it is evidenced, where it came
from, and which other cards it is derived from, supports or contradicts. Cards are never
edited and never deleted: a correction is a new card that *supersedes* the old one, and a
refuted card stays visible as a signposted dead end. Around that storage layer sits the part
that makes it work in practice — **hook-driven recall** that pushes relevant cards into the
session before the agent asks for them, and a **propose → review → approve** pipeline in
which background jobs may only propose and nothing enters the knowledge directory unreviewed.

Status: extracted and generalized from a working single-operator deployment that has been
running daily since mid-2026. The scripts here are the deployment's scripts with the paths
parameterized and the domain specifics removed. Numbers marked "calibrate" are that
deployment's values, not laws.

## For humans: what problem this solves

An agent that works with someone for months keeps re-deriving the same conclusions, repeating
documented dead ends, and stating yesterday's fact as today's. Context windows do not fix this
— they are per-session and they are lossy. Vector-store "memory" mostly fixes recall of *text*,
not the harder parts: whether a remembered claim was measured or merely reported, what refuted
it, and who approved it into the record.

KHMS's answers, in one line each:

- **Cards, not chat logs.** One claim per file, typed (`fact`, `problem→solution`,
  `decision→rationale`, `principle`, `policy`, …), so knowledge can be linked and counted.
- **Epistemic levels.** Observations carry `evidence: measured | observed | reported` and a
  source; rules are `derived` and must name what they were derived from. Confidence is
  *computed* from that graph, never hand-asserted.
- **Immutability.** No edits, no deletions. Corrections supersede; refutations stay readable,
  because "we already tried that and it failed" is among the most valuable things memory holds.
- **Retrieval as a floor plus a ceiling.** Hooks inject candidate cards automatically on a
  budget (the floor, which runs whether or not the agent remembers to look); explicit recall
  before hypotheses and proposals is the agent's own duty (the ceiling).
- **Graduated review.** Cheap models propose into an inbox, a stronger stage consolidates,
  and only an approving stage assigns IDs and writes into the knowledge directory.

### Prior art and further reading

- **Google Cloud's Open Knowledge Format (OKF)** — the closest thing to a standard for this
  storage layer: a directory of markdown files with YAML frontmatter, one required field
  (`type`), no runtime. KHMS's card storage converged on nearly the same shape independently;
  what OKF (v0.1 June 2026, v0.2 July 2026) does not define is the epistemic and process layer
  above it — evidence levels, mandatory provenance, refuted-not-deleted, computed belief, the
  propose→review cycle. If you want KHMS cards to interoperate, map the frontmatter.

  knowledge bases: a persistent, compounding, interlinked wiki instead of per-query RAG.
